# Word2Vec-Continuous-Skip-Gram-Implementation
This project implements Word2Vec using the Continuous Skip-Gram model from scratch in PyTorch. Raw WikiText-2 and WikiText-103 datasets are processed to build a custom dataset and data loader without using torchtext. The model is trained using mini-batch optimization, and inference retrieves the top-K most similar words using learned embeddings.
